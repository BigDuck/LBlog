# saying 
the homework to a girl ,*but these haven`t had any effect*
#code
it is very simple to you can see.because it is only a homework.
it only use *Servlet* and java 's JDBC so if are master you need not see it.
But I think the UI of my project you see and try it. I use ajax to update and delete and so on.
NO.1 the dialog I use * layer-v2.0 弹层组件 License LGPL  http://layer.layui.com/ By 贤心*
I think it is easy to use. of course it is beautiful.
I also use 'gritter','jeditable' and so on .you can see the more  through  my demo.
ok now we can see some UI .Don't mind the java 's code
